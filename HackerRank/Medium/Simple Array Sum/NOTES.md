          Simple Array Sum

          - Summary: The code uses a List to store integers. It first reads the number of elements in the array from standard input, then reads the array elements.  The `simpleArraySum` function iterates through the List, summing each element. Finally, the sum is written to standard output.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the `simpleArraySum` function iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.
          - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the List `ar` stores all the input elements.
