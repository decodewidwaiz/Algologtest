          Simple Array Sum

          - Summary: The code uses a List (dynamic array) to store the input integers.  It iterates through this List, summing each element to calculate the total sum. The sum is then returned. The main function handles input/output, reading the array size and elements from the standard input and writing the result to the standard output.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the code iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.
          - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is due to the space used to store the input array in memory.  The space used for the sum variable is constant.
