          Reverse an Array

          - Summary: The code uses two integer arrays. First, it creates a temporary array of the same size as the input array. It then iterates through the input array, copying elements in reverse order into the temporary array. Finally, it copies the elements from the temporary array back into the original array, effectively reversing it in place.

          - Time Complexity: O(n) because the code iterates through the input array twice, once to copy elements to the temporary array and once to copy them back to the original array.  The number of operations is directly proportional to the size of the array.
          - Space Complexity: O(n) because the code uses a temporary array of the same size as the input array to store the reversed elements. The space used is directly proportional to the size of the input array.
